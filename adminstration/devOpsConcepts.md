# Unit tests
These test each piece of the source code. They consist of testing individual functions and methods. You could also output your test coverage and validate that you’re meeting your code coverage requirements.

# Quality tests
Check that the code is well formatted, follows best practices, and has no serious coding errors. This is also called static code analysis, as it helps to produce high-quality code by looking for patterns in code that might generate bugs.

# Security tests
Inspect source code to uncover common security vulnerabilities and common security flaws (for example, leaked usernames and passwords).

# UI tests
Simulate user behavior through the system to ensure that the application works correctly in all supported browsers (including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Internet Explorer) and platforms (such as Windows, Linux, and macOS) and that it delivers the functionality promised in user stories.

# Integration tests
Check that services or components used by the application work well together and no defects exist. For example, an integration test might test an application’s interaction with the database.
